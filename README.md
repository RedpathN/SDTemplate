# SDTemplate
Project Template for Substance Designer

This is a simple starter template for designer projects, with a custom node for toggling between both Unity's and Unreal's default mask packing.

# Installation
Make sure a path to the directory of the GameMaskPacker file exists under Preferences -> Projects -> Library
Also ensure a path to CustomDefault under Preferences -> Projects -> General -> Template Directories

Personally, I have a folder for "Designer Library" with nodes and whatnot and a subfolder for templates, and just throw all my things in there as follows:

![LibraryDir](Images/LibraryDir.PNG?raw=true "LibraryDir")
![TemplatesDir](Images/TemplatesDir.PNG?raw=true "TemplatesDir")

# Use
Provided your librarys are all set, just make a new project and your template should be one of the options
